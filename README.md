***WORK IN PROGRESS***
> A simple, customizable, & configurable statusbar (eyecandy.ehan.dev)

## The Idea

Most statusbars lack proper documentation & are built cunfusingly and are window-manager dependent.

eyecandybar is an attempt to make a statusbar that lets the user dictate how the statusbar looks and what components are shown. It's meant to simply display information via text, like a floating terminal, but as a statusbar. The only difference being that there are no confusing "modules" that dictate settings and stuff like other statusbars.

## The Plan

"Do I really look like a guy with a plan?" - The Joker or something
